### Hello

I'm a software developer, an enthusiastic collaborator with Design, Engineering, and Product to deliver excellent things that users love.

I'm committed to superior developer experience. I insist on thorough READMEs, constructive comments, nonviolent bug reporting, and empathy for contributors.

I believe that all roles in software development contribute to a project's success, and seek to join teams that value user experience as highly as technical quality.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and (re)learning SQL, as a computer science student at Oregon State University.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for an appropriate internship for Summer 2023 (June - September). I bring my formal education and over ten years' experience with front-end Web technologies to the task of fullstack application development.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [email](mailto:job@twobanjos.com). I generally avoid synchronous means (phone, Slack, IRC).

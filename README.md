### Hi there 👋

I'm a front end web developer, and an enthusiastic collaborator with Design, Engineering, and Product to deliver excellent software that users love.

I'm committed to superior developer experience. I insist on thorough READMEs, constructive comments, nonviolent bug reporting, and empathy for contributors.

I believe that all roles in software development contribute to a project's success, and seek to join teams that value user experience as highly as technical quality.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a responsive layout redesign for an arts organization. I'm thrilled to be using flexbox and grid with abandon.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.

- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 📫 How to reach me: email. I generally avoid synchronous means (phone, Slack, IRC).

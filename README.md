### Hi there 

I'm a software developer, an enthusiastic collaborator with Design, Engineering, and Product to deliver excellent things that users love.

I'm committed to superior developer experience. I insist on thorough READMEs, constructive comments, nonviolent bug reporting, and empathy for contributors.

I believe that all roles in software development contribute to a project's success, and seek to join teams that value user experience as highly as technical quality.
